# xili-floom-slideshow
 
xili-floom-slideshow integrates the floom slideshow in WordPress theme or child theme.
Floom slideshow designed by [Oskar Krawczyk](http://nouincolor.com/) under MIT license is wonderful and amazing. For integration inside wordpress, it can be awesome ! xili-floom-slideshow tries to install it automatically but also allows personalizations.
= How it works ? =
**xili-floom-slideshow** inserts the javascript and css file inside the header of the theme. The images attached (but not inserted) to a post (or a page) are listed for the slideshow. And after adding a `[xilifloom]` shortcode inside the content of the post, the slideshow of the images of the gallery are automatically displayed.
With the dashboard Settings page, it is possible to change some properties of the slideshow without changing the original javascript: *by example, number of vertical 'venitian' blinds, speed, progress bar, visible captions, and moreâ€¦

Some properties can be attached to one post by using custom fields and to one shortcode by using params.
